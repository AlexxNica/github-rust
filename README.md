# Rust's GitHub v3 API

A Rust library to communicate with GitHub via the official v3 REST API.

## Issues

Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests.

## Contributing

I follow the _fork-and-pull_ git workflow for code contributions:

1. Fork the repo on GitHub
1. Commit changes to a branch in your fork
1. Make sure to pull the latest changes (rebase when possible) if not done yet!
  1. If you have conflicts, you should merge them, but try to prevent where possible!
1. Pull request "upstream" with your changes

You can contribute by fix things wherever they bother you, resolve an open issue or add new features. In case you can't help with code due to skill-, time- or energy-limitations, but you do have suggestions or errors to report, than feel free to open an issue.

Still not sure how you can contribute? [Contact me ](mailto:contact@glendc.com) and we'll find something :)
